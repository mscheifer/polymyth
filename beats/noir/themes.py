# Themes
# TODO: think more about the difference between big themes where the story poses
# conflicting arguments and then implies a conclusion, vs the smaller things
# I've been calling "thematic" where the reality of the story reflect
# character's emotion or deliberately serve to reinforce their arc. Do we need
# the big themes for a successful story and is there a better name for the
# little themes?
#
# TODO: is all progress, progress? (a la jurassic park)
#
# TODO: given all the suffering in the world, is it better to either live in the
# pain, stay cooped up inside and avoid it, or just die
#
# TODO: austere world
# - nighthwaks diner
# - brutalism
# - impossible / confusing geometries
# Resolution
# - finding beauty in a mandala
# - reverence of the pristine
